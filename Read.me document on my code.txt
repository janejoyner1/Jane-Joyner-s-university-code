Readme file for coding project:

The project requirement is to design and build a software system using a programming language. 
The code i have created is an algorithm which processes a data source. The data source i chosen is a CSV file. The code written enables the CSV file to be
transfered onto python, read, and parsed into a readable format. The idea used for my CSV file is a list pf headings as follows: name,monthly income,total
expenses and savings. Under these is information about each indivudual, specific to each heading. The code opens the csv file, parses and reads the contents, 
then presents each line of the csv file, which then converts into a sentenced format readable for humans.
